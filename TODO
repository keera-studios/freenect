* Why does Freenect export FFI? It should only export those types that are necessary,
  users should *not* be calling the low-level C functions.
* Why does is Freenect a top-level module? It should be in System., or even somewhere
  else inside System. For instance. System.Devices, or System.Input (although kinects
  and wiimotes act as output sources as well, so it's difficult to categorise them
  as either input or output).
